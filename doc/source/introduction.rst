Introduction
============

The package provides support for the following AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) tasks:

 - building the criteria hierarchy
 - inputting pairwise comparisons
 - calculating the weights for criteria and alternatives
 - calculating the consistency ratio (CR)   

The scope of the library is intentionally kept small. It implements only the minimum necessary to
order a set of alternatives according to a criteria and pairwise comparisons, using the AHP
technique and algorithms.

For more information about AHP, see for example Wikipedia:

Some good google searches are "ahp tutorial", "analytic hierarchy process" and "ahp saaty".
